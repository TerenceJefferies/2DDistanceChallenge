# Challenge: Calculate the distance between two players in a 2D world
When I started programming I was modifying computer games, and one thing I always had trouble understanding (and copied other programmers code to achieve) was how to calculate the distance between 2 players.

So, I set myself a challenge, calculate the distance between two players in a 2D world. If you imagine perhaps a chess board, or a gridded world (maybe Minecraft without any height)

For a few days I taught myself how to perform this sort of calculation, watching tutorials and YouTube videos that took me into mathematical calculations I never thought I would use.

## Instructions

To take part in the challenge, complete the following steps:

1. Clone this repository
2. Create your own branch, maybe with your GitHub username?
3. Finish your implementation in the `Answer/Calculator.js` file - The `getDistanceBetweenPlayers` method will be called when your answer is checked, so place your answers here. There is more help if you need it in the documentation for this function.

This is one of the joys of programming, as developers we have the opportunity to work in so many different fields and environments. From gaming to space. These sorts of challenges give us the opportunity to experiment with those ideas, and approach the challenges that individuals working in those fields tackle every day.
